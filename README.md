# Javascript Starter Pack (July 2018)

## Background

Inspired by [Cory House](https://github.com/coryhouse)'s Pluralsight course on "[Building a JavaScript Development Environment](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-development-environment/table-of-contents)", I've created an updated version of what he taught, with a few key differences:

- since nsp is deprecated, `npm audit` is used instead.
- no longer using `open` package due to security concerns.
- using the latest version of webpack (as of July 2018), config file is slightly different.

Other than that, there are some differences in versions and everything else is pretty much the same.

## The Stack

This project is to help a NodeJS Javascript developer start off with a full set of javascript-related toolkits at their disposal immediately.

It has the following:

- Package Manager: `npm`
- Server: NodeJS + `expressJS`
- Sharing WIP: `localtunnel`
- Scripting: `npm scripts`
- Transpiling: `babel`
- Bundling: `webpack`
- Linting: `eslint`
- Testing: `mocha` + `chai` + `jsdom`
- CI config: `travis ci` + `appveyor`
